        text: `Long before Victoria learned how to speak, laugh, or dream, she was already loved. Her parents had waited years for her, a kind of waiting that taught patience, softened voices, and deepened prayers. Each passing year carried hope, and though disappointment visited often, they never let it stay. When the doctor finally smiled and said, “You’re going to be parents,” her mother covered her mouth in disbelief, and her father stood silent—not because he felt nothing, but because happiness felt too fragile to touch. From that day, the house changed; the rooms felt warmer, and the future felt closer. Victoria grew inside her mother like a secret miracle, every movement and heartbeat bringing quiet joy. Her parents spoke to her even before she was born—telling her about the world, about love, and about how much space she already occupied in their hearts. The night she arrived was calm, with no storms or chaos, just soft lights and trembling hands. When her first cry echoed through the room, it was gentle—almost shy—yet it filled the space completely. Her mother wept as she held her, and her father smiled the kind of smile that comes only once in a lifetime. They named her Victoria, not because they wanted her to fight the world, but because her existence itself was their victory. As she grew, Victoria became a child full of brightness; she laughed easily and often, ran barefoot through the house, turning ordinary days into something lighter. She asked endless questions, played harmless pranks, and had a habit of hugging people suddenly, as if afraid love might escape if she waited too long. When her younger sister was born, Victoria took her role seriously—she guarded the crib, sang made-up songs, and proudly announced to anyone who would listen, “She’s mine.” The bond between them formed naturally—warm, protective, unbreakable. At night, Victoria loved sitting near the window, watching the moon rest quietly in the sky. She believed the moon listened, so she spoke to it in whispers—about school, her dreams, and the future she imagined so clearly. One day, she believed, she would fall in love—not the dramatic kind, but the gentle kind, the kind that stayed. She didn’t yet know that life would slowly test that belief—not cruelly or suddenly, but gently, the way growing always does. For now, she was only a child—laughing, dreaming, unaware that her story had just begun.`,

      text: `Victoria was just six years old, bright-eyed and curious, stepping into her second year of school. She loved the colorful books, the playground, and the soft hum of children’s laughter. But sometimes, the schoolyard wasn’t as kind as she hoped.That morning, Victoria walked through the dusty path leading to the school, her little backpack bouncing on her back. She hummed a tune she made up the night before. The sun was warm on her face, and everything seemed perfect — until she saw the group of boys waiting near the entrance.They were known troublemakers in the school — loud, rough, and sometimes cruel. Today, their eyes glinted with mischief as they spotted Victoria.“Hey, tiny one!” one boy sneered. “Where do you think you’re going?”Victoria’s heart quickened. She kept walking, hoping they’d leave her alone.

But the boys moved to block her path, surrounding her like a dark cloud.

“Don’t just walk away, we want to play,” another boy laughed, pushing her shoulder roughly.

Victoria stumbled, nearly falling, her small hands clutching her backpack straps tightly.

“Stop it!” she said, trying to sound braver than she felt.

Just then, a voice cut sharply through the noise. “Leave her alone!”

Victoria’s eyes widened as a girl stepped forward — tall for her age, with determined eyes and a fierce expression. It was Manasa, a girl from her class who had often sat quietly, but now stood like a shield in front of Victoria.

The boys sneered. “Or what? What will you do, Manasa?”

Without a moment’s hesitation, Manasa pushed the closest boy back, her small fists clenched.

Victoria watched in awe as Manasa’s courage seemed to grow with each second. The boys laughed, but Manasa didn’t back down.

“Go away, or I’ll make you,” Manasa said, her voice steady and strong.

One of the boys lunged forward, but Manasa dodged and swung her arm, hitting him hard enough to make him stumble. Another boy tried to grab her, but Manasa twisted free, landing a swift kick that sent him staggering.

Victoria’s heart pounded. She had never seen anyone stand up to those boys like that.

The fight was chaotic but brief. Manasa’s fierce spirit and quick moves pushed the boys back. Finally, defeated and wary, the boys ran off, shouting threats that they wouldn’t forget.

Manasa looked down at herself — her arms and legs scraped and bruised, her clothes torn in places. Her breath was heavy, and a thin trickle of blood ran down her forehead.

Victoria ran to her side, tears threatening to spill. “Are you okay? You hurt yourself!”

Manasa shook her head, smiling through the pain. “I’m fine. They won’t bother you anymore.”

Victoria wrapped her small arms around Manasa, feeling grateful beyond words.

Later that day, Victoria’s mother noticed the worry in her daughter’s eyes as she came home from school.

“What happened, Victoria?” she asked gently.

Victoria hesitated but then told her mother everything — the boys, the fight, and how Manasa had saved her.

Her mother’s eyes grew wide with concern. “We need to visit Manasa’s home,” she said firmly. “She was hurt because of this.”

Victoria nodded, feeling both worried and proud of her brave friend.

Together, they walked to Manasa’s house — a modest, warm home not far from theirs.

The door opened to reveal Manasa’s mother, who gasped softly at the sight of the bruises and scratches on her daughter’s arms and legs.

“Oh, Manasa!” she exclaimed, pulling her daughter inside with gentle hands.

Manasa’s father soon appeared, his face serious but kind.

Victoria’s mother introduced herself, and the two families sat together in the small living room. They spoke quietly, sharing stories of their daughters and their worries.

Manasa looked at Victoria, her eyes softening. “Thank you for coming,” she whispered.

Victoria smiled back, feeling the unspoken bond growing between them — a friendship forged not just by laughter, but by standing up for each other when it mattered most.

From that day on, their friendship deepened. They became inseparable — playing, learning, and protecting one another against whatever life threw their way.

Because sometimes, the strongest friendships are born in the fiercest battles.`,

But the peace didn’t last long.

One afternoon, as the girls walked home together, Victoria noticed a strange silence around the playground. The usual chatter and laughter were replaced by hushed voices and furtive glances.

Manasa’s smile faltered. “Something feels off,” she whispered.

Suddenly, Victoria caught sight of the boys from before — but this time, they weren’t alone. They were gathered in a tight group, their eyes scanning the yard like predators waiting for their chance.

Victoria’s heart raced. The boys hadn’t forgotten her. And they were planning something.

Manasa squeezed her hand. “We need to be careful.”

That night, Victoria lay awake, the moonlight casting long shadows on her bedroom wall. She thought about the fight, the bruises, and the scared but determined look on Manasa’s face.

What would happen if the boys came back? Would she be ready?

The next day at school, the boys whispered threats behind her back, their eyes cold and calculating. Victoria felt their stares burn through her like ice.

But Manasa was always there — watching, protecting, waiting.

Then came the note.

Victoria found it tucked inside her notebook during class: “You’re not safe. Watch your back.”

Her hands trembled as she showed it to Manasa.

“We have to tell someone,” Victoria said, voice barely above a whisper.

Manasa nodded, but her eyes held a secret worry.

Because sometimes, the hardest battles aren’t the ones you fight with fists — but the ones that come from fear, silence, and the unknown.`,

      text: `That evening, after Victoria found the threatening note in her notebook, she couldn’t sleep. Fear wrapped around her chest like a tight rope.

The next morning, she rushed to Manasa before class.

“Manasa… someone put this in my book,” Victoria whispered, showing the note with shaking hands.

Manasa read it.

For a second — she went completely still.

Then her lips twitched.

Then she burst out laughing.

Victoria stared at her.
“Why are you laughing?!”

Manasa covered her mouth, laughing harder.
“I can’t believe you still fall for this!”

“What do you mean?”

Manasa pulled another paper from her pocket — the same handwriting.

“I wrote it,” she said proudly.
“I just wanted to scare you a little. You were acting too serious lately.”

Victoria’s eyes widened.
“You did this?! I couldn’t sleep!”

Manasa laughed until tears formed.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry! But look at your face — priceless!”

Victoria hit her arm lightly.
“You’re terrible!”

Then she started laughing too.

Soon both of them were laughing so loudly that the teacher shouted from inside the classroom.

From that day on, the “threat note” became their inside joke.

Whenever Victoria got scared, Manasa would whisper,
“Watch your back 😈”

And they’d laugh again.

That prank became a memory of childhood — silly, harmless, unforgettable.Years passed quietly — the way time always does when no one is watching.

The banyan tree in the schoolyard grew taller.
The classrooms changed.
The notebooks grew heavier.
And the little girls who once ran barefoot through corridors were no longer little.

Victoria and Manasa were now in 9th class.

They still sat together — always the same bench near the window. Victoria liked watching the sky; Manasa liked watching Victoria smile. Their friendship had survived exams, teachers, misunderstandings, and growing silence that came with age.

The frightening note from years ago had long turned into a memory they laughed about.

“You really believed that?” Manasa would tease.

Victoria would groan.
“You scared me for two whole nightss!”
Manasa would laugh until tears filled her eyes.
“I just wanted to see your face! You looked like a scared kitten.”

They laughed about it often — a childish prank that once felt terrifying, now just a joke from a younger time.

Life felt normal again.

Until one morning.The school bell rang sharply.

Students rushed into the classroom, buzzing with excitement. Teachers whispered in the corridors. Something felt different.

Their class teacher walked in holding a file and smiled — the kind of smile that instantly created chaos.

“Students,” she said, raising her hand for silence,
“we have an announcement.”

The room went quiet.

“Next month, our school is organizing a three-day educational trip.”

For a second — silence.Then the classroom exploded.

“Yesss!”
“Finally!”
“Where are we going, ma’am?”
“I’m telling my parents today!”

Victoria’s eyes lit up like she was six again.

She turned to Manasa.
“Can you believe this? A trip! Together!”

Manasa smiled — but it was… thin. Almost delayed.

“Yeah,” she said softly. “Together.”The teacher continued, explaining destinations, permissions, forms, deadlines.

Everyone was going.

Everyone.

Except — no one noticed yet.During lunch break, students filled permission forms excitedly.

Pens scratched fast. Friends planned outfits, photos, bus seats.

Victoria filled her form quickly and slid it toward Manasa.

“Sign yours too,” she said cheerfully.
“We’ll sit together on the bus like always.”

Manasa didn’t move.

She stared at the paper.Seconds passed.

“Manasa?” Victoria asked. “What happened?”

Manasa slowly pushed the form back.

“I’m not going.”

Victoria blinked.
“What?”

“I can’t.”

“You mean… you don’t want to?”

Manasa shook her head.
“I can’t.”Her voice cracked slightly — so slightly Victoria almost missed it.

“But everyone’s going,” Victoria said.
“We waited for this for years.”

Manasa stood up suddenly.

“I need water.”

And she walked away.That afternoon, the school courtyard was loud with excitement.

Students ran everywhere, talking about the trip.

Victoria searched for Manasa.

She found her behind the old science block — sitting on the steps, knees pulled to her chest.

Crying.

Not silent tears.

Not gentle ones.

She was crying hard — the kind that shakes your body when you try too long to be strong.Victoria froze.

She had never seen Manasa cry like this.

Ever.

She ran to her.

“Manasa… hey… what happened?”

Manasa tried to wipe her face but failed. Tears kept falling.

“I thought I’d be okay,” she sobbed.
“I really thought I could handle it.”

“Handle what?” Victoria whispered.

Manasa pressed her palms against her eyes.

“My parents can’t afford it,” she said finally.“They said maybe next time. But there won’t be another next time.”

Victoria’s chest tightened.

“I didn’t want you to know,” Manasa continued.
“I didn’t want pity. I didn’t want you to stop talking about the trip.”

Her voice broke completely.

“I just wanted to pretend… for one more day… that I was like everyone else.”

Victoria sat beside her and held her hand tightly.

“You are like everyone else,” she said.

Manasa laughed bitterly through tears.

“Then why does it hurt this much?”That evening, Victoria lay awake again — just like she had years ago when she feared bullies.

But this fear was different.

This one had no enemy.

No one to fight.

Only helplessness.

The next few days felt heavy.

Victoria tried not to talk too much about the trip.

Manasa tried to smile.

But smiles can’t hide everything.Sometimes pain doesn’t come from danger —
it comes from watching others move forward while you stay behind.`,
